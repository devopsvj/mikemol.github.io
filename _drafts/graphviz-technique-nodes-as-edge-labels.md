So, let's revisit my last post, and look at one of the charts I built for it. It uses a technique I've found works around Dot's limited support for handling edge labels well.

See `A->B` with an edge label.

See `A->{B C D}` with an edge label.

See `A->B` and then `B->{C D E}`, with `B` serving as the edge label.

Now see what the last post's chart would look like if it used edge labels instead of nodes as labels.
